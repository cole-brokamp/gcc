# Geomarker Curation

## FAIR^[<https://data.org/resources/the-fair-data-principles/>]

- üîé **findable**: use a unique and persistent identifier, add rich metadata (using existing standards^[<https://rd-alliance.github.io/metadata-directory/standards/>])
- üîì **accessible**: store in a data repository (‚ö†Ô∏è personal/classified information, but metadata still accessible)
- ‚öôÔ∏è **interoperable**: use an open file format with controlled vocabularies, reference relevant datasets
- ‚ôªÔ∏è **reusable**: well documented, including a description (README with data sources, background, and how to reproduce the data), a data dictionary (field descriptions, units, titles, missingness), and usage licenses (for code^[<https://choosealicense.com/licenses/>] or data/presentations/papers^[<https://creativecommons.org/about/cclicenses/>]) 

## The White House's Equitable Data Working Group^[<https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/04/22/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-releases-recommendations-for-advancing-use-of-equitable-data/>]:

- Equitable data are "those that allow for rigorous assessment of the extent to which government programs and policies yield consistently fair, just, and impartial treatment of all individuals."
- Equitable data should ‚Äúilluminate opportunities for targeted actions that will result in demonstrably improved outcomes for underserved communities.‚Äù
- Make disaggregated data the norm while being "... intentional about when data are collected and shared, as well as how data are protected so as not to exacerbate the vulnerability of members of underserved communities, many of whom face the heightened risk of harm if their privacy is not protected."

## Disaggregation

- Open data can fall short of driving action if it is not equitable.
- Disaggregating^[[Kader F, Doan LN, Lee M, Chin MK, Kwon SC, Yi SS. Disaggregating race/ethnicity data categories: Criticisms, dangers, and opposing viewpoints.](https://doi.org/10.1377/forefront.20220323.555023)] data by sensitive attributes, like race and ethnicity, can elucidate inequities that would otherwise remain hidden.
- "Open data is necessary and **not** sufficient to drive the type of action that we need to create a more equitable society." - U.S. Chief Data Scientist, Denice Ross^[<https://www.fedscoop.com/us-chief-data-scientist-interview/>]

## The TRUST principles for digital repositories^[[Lin D, Crabtree J, Dillo I, Downs RR, Edmunds R, Giaretta D, De Giusti M, L‚ÄôHours H, Hugo W, Jenkyns R, Khodiyar V. The TRUST Principles for digital repositories. Scientific Data. 2020 May 14;7(1):144.](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-020-0486-7)]

Creating and maintaining an open community-level data resource equips the entire community for data-powered decision making *and* boosts organizational trustworthiness. Demonstrating reliability and capability of appropriately managing shared data helps earn the trust of organizations and communities intended to be served:

- ü§≤ **transparent**: make specific repository services and data holdings verifiable by publicly accessible evidence
- üìÉ **responsible**: ensure authenticity and integrity of data holdings
- üë• **user-focused**: meet data management norms and expectations of target user communities
- ‚è≥Ô∏èÔ∏è **sustainable**: preserve services and data holdings for the long-term
- ‚öôÔ∏è **technological**: provide infrastructure and capabilities supporting secure, persistent, and reliable services

1. Define common data specification for community-level data considering FAIR, TRUST, privacy, equitable disaggregation.
1. Create and disseminate methods and tools for harmonizing and *sharing* community-level data, including spatiotemporal interpolation, data validation, API for accessing data at scale and on demand.
1. Serve a portable interactive data catalog derived on demand from metadata and an open API to link to or include with other data catalogs (e.g., GCCHDC, C2D2).
1. Create an interactive web application to explore community-level distributions across Cincinnati and explore simple relationships between community-level measures.

## CoDEC Standards Build on Frictionless Standards

Developed by the [Open Knowledge Foundation](https://okfn.org/), the frictionless^[<https://frictionlessdata.io/>] [standards](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/) are a set of patterns for describing data, including datasets ([Data Package](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/data-package/)), files ([Data Resource](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/data-resource/)), and tables ([Table Schema](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/table-schema/)). 

Open and robust tooling around low-code and no-code creation, curation, and sharing of data.

# Privacy and Geomarkers

## 

### Privacy

- Data are people^[[Zook M, Barocas S, Boyd D, Crawford K, Keller E, Gangadharan SP, Goodman A, Hollander R, Koenig BA, Metcalf J, Narayanan A. Ten simple rules for responsible big data research. PLoS computational biology. 2017 Mar 30;13(3):e1005399.](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005399)]
- Privacy is a spectrum of the tradeoffs between risks and benefits to individuals and populations
- Data collected at the individual-level by one organization often cannot be shared^[<https://sharing.nih.gov/data-management-and-sharing-policy/protecting-participant-privacy-when-sharing-scientific-data/principles-and-best-practices-for-protecting-participant-privacy>] with another organization due to legal restrictions or organization-specific data governance policies

### Protected Health Information (PHI)

- Confidentiality of research subjects must be safeguarded
- HIPAA-defined "Safe Harbor" provision prohibits sharing of identifiers and quasi-identifiers, such as:
  - time finer than a calendar year
  - spatial boundary with < 20,000 residents

##

### Sharing Data with PHI

- Consent often not obtained for unforeseen future analyses
- Retrospective consent often not feasible + consent bias
- IRB and institutional DUA approvals can be lengthy and have different requirements
- Transmission of PHI to a third party often not possible

### De- and Re-identification

- deidentification can ensure small, *but non-zero*, chance of reidentification
- re-identification of identifiers ‚â† re-identification of quasi-identifiers
  - quasi-identifiers recovered by merging with extant datasets
  - institutional restrictions on sharing of quasi-identifiers

DeGAUSS is a curated and standardized library for secure, efficient, automated, and reproducible linkage of geomarkers to protected health and geolocation data at scale.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

- Container framework that reads and writes CSV files
- No extensive computational resources
- No geospatial or computing expertise required
- *PHI is never exposed to a third party or the internet*

# Parcel-level Geomarkers

## Street range geocoding

- Estimate exact location of a building on a street using the street number and street range address geographies
- Ideal for linkage with area-level data, but inherently not precise enough to link a residential address to a residential parcel
- Real-world addresses are messy, inconsistent, 'inaccurate'
- No widely-adopted address component standards

## Parcel linkage

1. Parse address into distinct components (`usaddress`, `libpostal`)
2. Apply multivariable linkage methods (`hashdress`, `dedupe`)

### {[parcel](https://github.com/geomarker-io/parcel)} package for R:

- clean addresses and parse components
- provide motivating data resources of Hamilton County Parcels and characteristics
- join addresses to parcel identifiers based on included model pretrained on EHR records in Hamilton County
- special cases support for institutional addresses, apartment complexes, condos, owner name/address linkage
